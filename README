EnnuiCastr is a system for recording multiple users distributed across the
world in a well-synchronized way, without significant loss, over the web. Note
that this includes only client-side software; the server side is currently only
built into Craig, another piece of recording software by the same author. A
small example server is provided for testing.

EnnuiCastr is licensed under the ISC license, and can be used for more-or-less
any purpose so long as you retain the copyright notices.

EnnuiCastr has a number of dependencies each under their own compatible
license. See the directories vad, recorder and libflac for more information on
them.

No documentation is provided for running your own instances of EnnuiCastr or
for its protocol.
