EnnuiCastr is a system for recording multiple users distributed across the
world in a well-synchronized way, without significant loss, over the web. Note
that this includes only client-side software; the server side is expected to be
built into something else, such as (eventually) Craig, another piece of
recording software by the same author.

No documentation is provided for running your own instances of EnnuiCastr or
for its protocol.
