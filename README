EnnuiCastr is a system for recording multiple users distributed across the
world in a well-synchronized way, without significant loss, over the web. Note
that this includes only client-side software; the server side is expected to be
built into something else, such as Craig, another piece of recording software
by the same author. A small example server is provided for testing.

EnnuiCastr is licensed under the ISC license, and so can be used for
more-or-less any purpose so long as you retain the copyright notices.

EnnuiCastr depends on opus-recorder (
https://github.com/chris-rudmin/opus-recorder ), a minified version of which is
included in the recorder/ directory.

No documentation is provided for running your own instances of EnnuiCastr or
for its protocol.
