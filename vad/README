This is copied from the webrtc_vad repo as specified in VERSION, with the
following changes:

* I've added the *correct* license header. The LICENSE file in the webrtc_vad
  repository is *wrong*. It's Mozilla's standard license info, but as
  webrtc_vad is just an emscripten-compiled copy of WebRTC's VAD, it is
  WebRTC's license that applies, not Mozilla's.

* The default version uses a global named "Module". I renamed it to
  WebRTCVAD_Module to avoid conflicts.
